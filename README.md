# Final-Project-Tableau
FIFA18 Clean Dataset Analysis
## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
In this project, I assumed the role of a soccer agency with the objective of identifying the optimal countries for nurturing and developing soccer talents. The primary goal was to leverage data analysis to determine which countries would be most suitable for our talents to thrive in.
## Process
### (your step 1)
The initial phase involved acquiring and preprocessing the FIFA18 dataset. I retrieved the dataset from the provided download link and imported it into Tableau. During this process, I meticulously reviewed the dataset's data types to ensure accuracy. I encountered an issue where certain countries were not recognized by Tableau, prompting me to manually assign the correct country names.
### (your step 2)
Subsequently, I embarked on creating various visualizations to gain deeper insights into the dataset. These visualizations were crucial for both comprehending the data and formulating a strategy to address our agency's objectives. The visualizations were designed with the intent of presenting findings effectively to the agency's stakeholders.
## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)
After conducting extensive analysis and generating insightful visualizations, I reached the conclusion that Spain was the most favorable destination for sending our players and talents to further their careers. This decision was grounded in the data-driven insights derived from the FIFA18 dataset.
## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
Throughout the project, I encountered some challenges. Notably, I faced difficulties in saving my work locally on my machine. This issue, while relatively minor, necessitated additional troubleshooting and time to resolve. 
## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
Given more time and resources, I intend to continue working with this dataset to uncover further insights. Specifically, I plan to explore the relationships between players' ages and their ratings, as well as investigate whether a combination of different player attributes can influence a player's overall rating over time. These additional analyses will enable us to target specific categories of young players for recruitment, solidifying our agency's position as a premier scouting agency for soccer clubs.
